Our uniforms were taken to the dry cleanerÃ¢â¬â¢s to be cleaned and pressed. The little bird with the odd crest really drew our attention. We had dressed warmly for our weekend hiking trip in the mountains. Our guide had stressed the importance of bringing plenty of water. At harvest time we worked alongside the farmers that flay the wheat. I think we all felt that the first play we saw was simply riveting. Afterwards we made all sorts of silly creatures with the bright clay. Her hair would splay across her shoulders whenever she brushed it. A white sleigh carried the exuberant actors off of the stage. Some fresh hot fries would taste wonderful with a chocolate milkshake. I found a wonderful prize in my box of caramel popcorn. Sun dries our laundry as quickly as any machine can do it.
