How to add a meta-analysis dataset
==================================

- Put all of its data in a google spreadsheet, naming the columns according to the codebook:

	`https://docs.google.com/document/d/1szXxrv75qTVx-4adlLrwmjWSDIBJfMH09dzh9733mog/edit`

- Make the sharing settings on the spreadsheet `Anyone with link can view`.

- Go to `File` > `Publish to the web` and click on `Publish`.

- This gives you a link. Copy the key part of the link (the part in between `d/` and `/pubhtml`).

- Add en entry in the file `datasets.json` with the dataset's name and key, such as:
	    {
	        "name": "Word Segmentation",
	        "key": "1XN6VaYRs7CStrINct_rr2d6rh6WN28xFiIGB5T1vkzY"
	    }
