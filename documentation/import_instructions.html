How to add a meta-analysis dataset
==================================

- Put all of its data in a google spreadsheet, naming the columns according to the codebook:

	`https://docs.google.com/document/d/1szXxrv75qTVx-4adlLrwmjWSDIBJfMH09dzh9733mog/edit`

- Make the sharing settings on the spreadsheet `Anyone with link can view`.

- Go to `File` > `Publish to the web` and click on `Publish`.

- This gives you a link. Copy the key part of the link (the part in between `d/` and `/pubhtml`).

- Add an entry in the file `datasets.json` with the dataset's name, key, desired filename, citation, link for further information, number of papers, and brief description:
		{
			"name": "Word segmentation",
			"key": "1XN6VaYRs7CStrINct_rr2d6rh6WN28xFiIGB5T1vkzY",
			"filename": "data/word_segmentation.csv",
			"citation": "(Bergmann & Cristia, under revision)",
			"link": "https://sites.google.com/site/inworddb/",
			"N": "48",
			"description": "An analysis of studies on infants' extraction of words from running, natural speech as evidenced in paradigms built on listening times."
		}

- Look at `mapping.json`. If the dataset has any values for `response_mode`, `procedure`, or `method` that are not listed there, either change them in the dataset or add them to mapping.

- Run a script to check that there are no issues with the dataset:

		$ Rscript scripts/cache_datasets.R

- If you want the dataset to be include immediately, run

		$ scripts/cache_datasets.sh

  Otherwise it should get included automatically during the next night.
