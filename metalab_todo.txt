- inphondb has huge SEs for some studies (special cases?)
- labadv weird curve in funnel plot
- forest plot
  - sort order? toggle?
  - uniqueID + exot_num as IDs
- plot headings, brief descriptions


longitudinal (pointing, invarinf):
  - no age moderator
  - different age scatterplot
  - add invarinf --> might require different data structure
  - change pointing to have same structure as invarinf

non-ES things: same plot, just label something other than "Effect Size"
