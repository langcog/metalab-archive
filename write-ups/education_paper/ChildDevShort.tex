  \abstract{Letter of Intent: Using data from MetaLab, we analyze large-scale
patterns in the infant language development literature on the
methodological level. We describe recent concerns about statistical
power and its role in lowering replicability in the behavioral sciences
more broadly. Although statistical power has been a concern in infancy
research, no extant data speak to the average level of power in this
area. Addressing this gap, we calculate the typical statistical power
for experiments across our database by comparing sample sizes in each
experiment to the meta-analytic estimate of the effect size. The results
of this analysis are striking: With a median effect size of Cohen's d =
.59 across all 13 phenomena, and a typical sample size of 18
participants per cell, power is at 40\%. This suggests that typical
sample sizes in infancy research are far too low and researchers do not
habitually consider effect sizes in their experiment planning. We also
show that seminal publications in our literature typically over-estimate
the median effect size relative to later investigations. Therefore, they
are an inappropriate guide to experiment planning. At the same time, we
find no evidence for p-hacking within phenomena. We conclude with
recommendations for experimental planning and reporting. For others
building new MAs and meta-MAs, we provide recommendations to make those
datasets useful to their communities, including how to diagnose
inappropriate research practices and to make their datasets, as
demonstrated with MetaLab, open and dynamic. To further promote the use
of meta-analyses, we have developed educational materials appropriate to
developmentalists interested in building new MAs, or contributing
additional data to extant MAs that have been set up in a
community-augmented fashion.}

Empirical research is built on a never-ending conversation between
theory and data, between expectations and observations. Theories lead to
new experimental questions and new data in turn help us refine our
theories. This process is based on access to reliable empirical data.
Unfortunately, the assessment of the value of empirical data points
seems to be largely determined by publishability (Nosek, Spies, \&
Motyl, 2012), which (partially) depends on significant and surprising
outcomes. Aiming for publishability in turn can lead to practices that,
when ensconced, can seriously undermine the quality of the data in whole
fields. In a seminal contribution, Ioannidis (2005) has concluded that
most empirical research findings are false, with the actual proportion
of false findings being dependent on several features, including the
underlying effect size of a particular phenomenon, typical sample sizes,
and the degrees of flexibility in data collection and analysis --
factors that are all relevant to developmental research. According to
some interpretations, inappropriate research and reporting practices may
be to blame for the surprisingly high proportion of non-replicable
findings in psychology (J. P. Simmons, Nelson, \& Simonsohn, 2011).
Replicability, however, is crucial in experimental sciences,
particularly for developmental research: Theories should be based on
robust findings and their boundary conditions have to be explored with
sufficiently powered studies to avoid an excess of false negatives.
Further, translating findings on child development into practice
requires a solid knowledge base.

We survey and quantify current practices in developmental research using
meta-analytic tools. To this end, we take a different approach from the
typical meta-analysis by aggregating over multiple datasets. Using a
collection of standardized meta-analyses we focus on key experimental
design choices, namely sample size and ensuing power as well as method
choices. In doing so, we provide the (to our knowledge) first assessment
of typical practices of developmental research. Based on our findings
and experiences with building meta-analyses and using meta-analytic
tools, we end this paper with suggestions for change.

In this paper, we focus on language acquisition research, covering a
variety of methods (10 in total) and participant ages, from newborns to
3.50-year-olds. Since our approach is accompanied by extensive
educational materials, completely open data and scripts, and we build on
open source software (particularly R, R Core Team (2016)), our approach
can easily be extended to other domains of child development research
and we strongly encourage fellow researchers to build similar
collections of meta-analyses describing and quantifying phenomena in
their sub-domain of developmental research.

\subsection{Key concerns for robust research in developmental
science}\label{key-concerns-for-robust-research-in-developmental-science}

In this section we review potential hindrances to developmental research
being robust and reproducible, and briefly describe how we will assess
the status quo. Note that all these descriptions are by necessity brief,
for extended discussions we provide references to suitable readings.
\textbf{TODO: Check / ADD}

\subsubsection{Statistical power}\label{statistical-power}

Power refers to the probability of detecting an effect and correctly
rejecting the null hypothesis if an effect is indeed present in a
population; power is therefore dependent on the underlying effect size
and the sample size. Of course, low power is problematic in terms of
increased chances of type-II errors (i.e., failure to find a significant
result when there is an underlying effect). It has become increasingly
clear that low power is also problematic in the case of type-I errors,
or false positives, as the effects reported in such cases will be
over-estimating the true effect (see also Ioannidis, 2005, and
@Simmons2011 and Button et al. (2013)). This makes appropriate planning
for future research more difficult, as sample sizes will be too small,
leading to null results due to insensitive research designs rather than
the absence of the underlying effect. This poses a serious hindrance for
work building on seminal studies, including replications and extensions.

Underpowered studies pose an additional and very serious problem for
developmental researchers that interpret significant findings as
indicating that a skill is \enquote{present} and non-significant
findings as a sign that it is \enquote{absent}. In fact, even in the
most rigorous study design and execution, null results will occur
regularly; consider a series of studies with 80\% power (a number
typically deemed sufficient), where every fifth result will not reflect
that there is a true effect present in the population. We outline
alternative approaches that allow for such statements in the discussion
section.

To investigate the status quo, we first compute typical power per
phenomenon, based on meta-analytic effect sizes and typical sample size.
We explore which effect sizes would be detectable with the sample sizes
present in our datasets. We additionally investigate how researchers
might determine sample sizes using a different heuristic, following the
first paper on their phenomnenon of interest.

\subsubsection{Method choice}\label{method-choice}

Improving procedures in developmental research can be considered both an
economical and ethical necessity, because the population is difficult to
recruit and test. For this reason, developmentalists often
\enquote{tweak} paradigms and develop new ones to increase reliability
and robustness, all with the aim of obtaining a clearer signal.
Especially given the time constraints, we aim to collect a maximum of
data in the short time span infants and children are willing to
participate in a study. Emerging technologies, such as eye-tracking and
tablets, have consequently been eagerly adopted (Frank, Sugarman,
Horowitz, Lewis, \& Yurovsky, 2016). As a result, multiple ways to tap
into the same phenomenon exist; consider for example the fact that both
headturn-based paradigms and offline as well as online measurements of
eye movements are frequently being employed to measure infant-directed
speech preference (Dunst, Gorman, \& Hamby, 2012, and @Manybabies1).

It remains an open question to what extent these different methods lead
to comparable results. It is possible that some are more robust, but it
is difficult to extract such information based on single studies that
use different materials and test various age groups (but see the
large-scale experimental approach by ManyBabies Collaborative, 2017).
Aggregating over experimental results via meta-analytic tools, in
contrast, allows us to extract general patterns of higher or lower noise
by comparison of effect sizes, which are directly affected by the
variance of the measurement.

We will assess in how far the different methods used in the present
collection of meta-analyses vary in the resulting effect size. Further,
taking possible resource limitations into account, we consider drop-out
rates as a potential measure of interest and discuss whether higher
exclusion rates coincide with more precise measures, yielding higher
effect sizes.

\subsubsection{P-hacking}\label{p-hacking}

Undisclosed flexibility during data collection and analysis is a problem
independent of the availability of various methods to conduct infant
studies. To begin with, using flexible stopping rules, where the
decision to stop or continue testing depends on the result of a
statistical test, increases the likelihood to obtain a
\enquote{significant} outcome well beyond the traditional 5\%. As for
analytic flexibility, researchers can conduct multiple significance
tests with several more or less related dependent variables. In
developmental research, this problematic practice encompasses
transforming the same measured data into multiple dependent variables
(such as mean scores, difference scores, percentages, and so on) as well
as selectively excluding trials and re-testing the new data for
statistical significance. Next, multiple conditions that selectively can
be dropped from the final report increase the number of significance
tests. Finally, it is problematic to post hoc introduce covariates, most
prominently gender, and test for an interaction with the main effect.
Finally combining two or more of these strategies again inflated the
number of significant results. All these practices might seem innocuous
and geared towards \enquote{bringing out} an effect the researcher
believes is real, yet they can inflate the number of significant
\emph{p}-values, effectively rendering \emph{p}-values and the notion of
statistical significance meaningless (Ioannidis, 2005, and
@Simmons2011).

It is typically not possible to assess whether flexibility led to false
positive in a given report. However, we can measure symptoms of such
practices. A possible \enquote{symptom} is a distribution of
\emph{p}-values with increased frequency just below the significance
threshold, and/or an overall flat distribution of \emph{p}-values
indicating that those results that were significant in fact represent
the to be expected 5\% type-I error. We will use p-curves to assess both
whether there is an excess of \emph{p}-values just below the
significance threshold and whether \emph{p}-values are distributed in a
way that is or is not consistent with a true phenomenon being tested
(Simonsohn, Nelson, \& Simmons, 2014).

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Data}\label{data}

All data presented and analyzed in the present paper are part of a
standardized collection of meta-analyses (MetaLab), and are freely
available via the companion website \url{http://metalab.stanford.edu}.
Currently, MetaLab contains 12 meta-analyses, or datasets, where core
parts of each meta-analysis are standardized to allow for the
computation of common effect size estimates and for analyses that span
across different phenomena. These standardized variables include study
descriptors (such as citation and peer review status), participant
characteristics (including mean age, native language), methodological
information (for example what dependent variable was measured), and
information necessary to compute effect sizes (number of participants,
if available means and standard deviations of the dependent measure,
otherwise test statistics of the key hypothesis test, such as t-values
or F scores). This way, the analyses presented in this paper become
possible.

MetaLab contains datasets that address phenomena ranging from
infant-directed speech preference to mutual exclusivity, sampled
opportunistically. Meta-analyses are either based on data collected with
involvement of subsets of authors of this paper (n=10 datasets) or they
were extracted from previously published meta-analyses related to
language development (n=2, Colonnesi, Stams, Koster, \& Noom, 2010;
Dunst et al., 2012). In the former case, we attempted to document as
much detail as possible for each entered experiment (note that a paper
can contain many experiments, as shown in Table 1). Detailed
descriptions of all phenomena covered by MetaLab, including which papers
and other sources have been considered, can be found on the companion
website at \url{http://metalab.stanford.edu}.

\subsection{Statistical approach}\label{statistical-approach}

As dependent measure, we report Cohen's \emph{d}, a standardized effect
size based on comparing sample means and their variance. Effect size was
calculated when possible from means and standard deviations across
designs with the appropriate formulae. When these data were not
available, we used test statistics, more precisely t-values or F scores
of the test assessing the main hypothesis. We also computed effect size
variance, which allows to weigh each effect size when aggregating across
studies. The variance is mainly determined by the number of
participants; intuitively effect sizes based on larger samples will be
assigned more weight. Note that for research designs testing the same
participants in two conditions (for example measuring reactions of the
same infants to infant- and adult-directed speech), correlations between
those two measures are needed to estimate the effect size variance. This
measure is usually not reported, despite being necessary for effect size
calculation. Some correlations could be obtained through direct contact
with the original authors (see e.g., Bergmann \& Cristia, 2016 for
details), the remaining ones were imputed. We report details of effect
size calculation in the supplementary materials and make available all
scripts used in the present paper.

\subsubsection{Meta-analytic model}\label{meta-analytic-model}

Meta-analytic effect sizes were estimated using random-effect models
where effect sizes were wrighted by their inverse variance. We further
used a multilevel approach, which takes into account not only the effect
sizes and variance of single studies, but also that effect sizes from
the same paper will be based on more similar studies than effect sizes
from different papers (Konstantopoulos, 2011). We relied on the
implementation in the metafor package (Viechtbauer, 2010) of R (R Core
Team, 2016). Excluded as outliers were effect sizes more than three
standard deviations away from the median effect size within each
dataset, thus accounting for the difference in median effect size across
phenomena.

\subsubsection{P-curves}\label{p-curves}

For analyses involving \emph{p}-values, we re-computed \emph{p}-values
from our effect-size estimates. This is due to the following reasons:
First, we did not have the same information available for all data
points, even within the same meta-analysis. Second, exact
\emph{p}-values are often not reported but rather as \emph{p}\textless{}
.05 and similar notations. In addition, two datasets only contain effect
sizes, because they are based on extant meta-analyses. Finally,
\emph{p}-values are not always computed and reported correctly or
consistently (Nuijten, Hartgerink, Assen, Epskamp, \& Wicherts, 2016).
The recalculation pipeline is as follows: For papers where t-values were
not available, we transform Cohen's \emph{d} into Pearson's \emph{r},
from which it is possible to calculate a \emph{t}-value. \emph{p}-values
were then computed accordingly from t-values (either reported or
re-calculated), taking into account the degrees of freedom of a specific
experiment.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Sample sizes, effect sizes, and
power}\label{sample-sizes-effect-sizes-and-power}

Table 1 provides a summary of typical sample sizes and effect sizes by
phenomenon. We calculated typical power using the pwr package (Champely,
2015) based on the meta-analytical effect size and the median number of
participants within each phenomenon. We remind the reader that
recommendations are for this value to be above 80\%, which refers to a
likelihood that four out of five studies show a significant outcome for
an effect truly present in the population.

As could be expected, sample sizes are small across all phenomena, with
the overall median in the MetaLab database being 17. Effect sizes tend
to fall into ranges of small to medium effects, as defined by Cohen
(Cohen, 1988). The overall median effect size of all datasets is Cohen's
\emph{d} = 0.57. As a result of those two factors, studies are typically
severely under-powered: Assuming a paired t-test (within-participant
designs are the most frequent in MetaLab) it is possible to detect an
effect in 80\% of all studies when Cohen's \emph{d} = 0.72; in other
words, this sample size would be appropriate when investigating a medium
to large effect. When comparing two independent groups, the effect size
that would be detectable with a sample size of 17 participants per group
increases to Cohen's \emph{d} = 0.99, a large effect that is rarely
observed as meta-analytic effect size in the present collection of
developmental meta-analyses.

Inversely, to detect the typical effect of Cohen's \emph{d} = 0.57,
studies would have to test 26 participants in a paired design, 9. It
should be noted that this disparity between observed and necessary
sample size varies greatly across phenomena.

\subsubsection{The role of participant
age}\label{the-role-of-participant-age}

Participant age can be assumed to interact with effect size both for
conceptual and practical reasons. Younger infants might show smaller
effects in general because they are more immature in terms of their
information processing abilities, and they are not yet as experienced
with, and proficient in, their native language in particular. As to
practical reasons, measurements might be more noisy for younger
participants, as they could be a more difficult population to recruit
and test. We find no linear relationship between infant age and sample
size, effect size, and derived power on the level of meta-analyses. In
addition, the prediction that older participants might be easier to
recruit and test is not reflected in the observed sample sizes. However,
the only two datasets with appropriate (or some might say overly large)
power typically test infants older than one year.

\subsubsection{Seminal papers as basis for sample size
planning}\label{seminal-papers-as-basis-for-sample-size-planning}

As Table 1 shows, experimenters are frequently not including a
sufficient number of participants to observe a given effect -- assuming
the meta-analytic estimate is accurate. It might, however, be possible,
that power has been determined based on a seminal paper to be replicated
and/or expanded. Initial reports tend to overestimate effect sizes
(Jennions \& MÃ¸ller, 2002), possibly explaining the lack of power in
some datasets and studies.

We extracted for each dataset the oldest paper and therein the largest
reported effect size and re-calculated power accordingly, using the
median sample size of a given dataset. The results are shown in Table 2.
It turns out that in some cases, such as native and non-native vowel
discrimination, sample size choices match well with the oldest report.
The difference in power, noted in the last column, can be substantial,
with native vowel discrimination and phonotactic learning being the two
most salient examples. Here, sample sizes match well with the oldest
report and studies would be appropriately powered if this estimate were
representative of the true effect. For four datasets neither the seminal
paper nor meta-analytic effect size seem to be basis for sample size
decisions.

\subsection{Method choice}\label{method-choice-1}

Choosing a robust method can help increase the power of studies, because
more precise measurements lead to larger effects and thus require fewer
participants to be tested. However, the number of participants relates
to the final sample and not how many infants had to be invited into the
lab. We thus first quantify whether methods differ in their typical
drop-out rate, as economic considerations might drive method choice. To
this end we consider all methods across datasets in MetaLab which have
more than 10 associated effect sizes and for which information on the
number of dropouts was reported; this information is not always reported
in published papers. In the case of the two meta-analyses we added based
on published reports, the information of drop-out rates was not
available. Therefore, the following analyses only cover 6 methods and
224 data points.

\subsubsection{Drop-out rates across
procedures}\label{drop-out-rates-across-procedures}

The results of a linear mixed effect model predicting dropout rate by
method and mean participant age (while accounting for the different
phenomena and associated underlying effect sizes being tested) are
summarized in the table below. The results show that, taking the most
frequently used central fixation as baseline, conditioned headturn and
stimulus alternation have significantly more drop-outs, while forced
choice has significantly less. Figure 1 underlines this observation.
Overall, stimulus alternation leads to the highest drop-out rates, which
lies at around 50\% (see Figure 1), and forced choice to the lowest.
Participant age interacts with the different methods. We observe an
increase in drop-out rates, which is most prominent in conditioned
headturn (a significant interaction) and headturn preference procedure
(where the interaction approaches significance).

Interestingly, the methods with lower drop-out rates, namely central
fixation and headturn preference procedure, are among the most frequent
ones in MetaLab and certainly more frequent than those with higher
drop-out rates, indicating that the proportion of participants that can
be retained might indeed inform researchers' choice. This observation
points to the previously mentioned limitations regarding the participant
pool, as more participants will have to be tested to arrive at the same
final sample size.

Methods which retain a higher percentage of participants might either be
more suitable to test infants, decreasing noise as most participants are
on task, or less selective, thus increasing noise as participants who
for example are fussy are more likely to enter the data pool. We thus
turn to a meta-analytic assessment of the same methods discussed here.

\subsubsection{Effect sizes as a function of
procedure}\label{effect-sizes-as-a-function-of-procedure}

We built a meta-analytic model with Cohen's \emph{d} as the dependent
variable, method and mean age centered as independent variables. The
model also includes the variance of \emph{d} for sampling variance, and
paper within meta-analysis as a random effect nested within phenomenon
(because we assume that within a paper experiments and thus effect sizes
will be more similar to each other than across papers). We again
selected central fixation as baseline method and limited this analysis
to the same methods that we investigated above.

\end{figure}

The model results in Table 2 show that compared to central fixation
conditioned headturn and forced choice yield reliably higher effect
sizes, all other methods do not statistically differ from this baseline
(note that looking while listening is approaching significance). When
factoring in age, looking while listening shows a significant
interaction, and conditioned headturn approaches significance,
indicating an increase in effect sizes as infants mature. Age is
marginally above the significance threshold, the positive estimate
further underlines that overall effect sizes increase for older
participants -- an observation consistent with the view that infants and
toddlers become more proficient language users and are increasingly able
to react appropriately in the lab.

\subsubsection{P-hacking}\label{p-hacking-1}

Finally, we assess the distributions of \emph{p}-values in our dataset,
in an approach comparable to p-curves (Simonsohn et al., 2014). Further
analyses assessing publication bias can be found in the supplementary
materials. Figure 3 shows the distribution of \emph{p}-values below the
significance threshold of .05. The bars indicate counts and the line
plot represents density. Note that \emph{p}-values were recalculated
based on effect sizes to ensure a consistent basis for our conclusions.
For reliability purposes, we only discuss datasets with more than 10
\emph{p}-values between 0 and .05. In the absence of questionable
research practices and the presence of an effect, we expect a
distribution biased towards small values. In the absence of both
p-hacking and an effect, the distribution should be flat, as all
\emph{p}-values are equally likely to occur. Unexpected \enquote{bumps}
towards higher \emph{p}-values in contrast can indicate severe
p-hacking, including adding and removing samples and/or predictors, and
conducting multiple statistical analyses (Ioannidis, 2005, J. P. Simmons
et al. (2011)).

All of the datasets that could be included in this analysis display the
expected right skew, but for some, \emph{p}-values just below .05 are
more frequent than smaller ones between .02 and .03. For one dataset,
\enquote{phonotactic learning} this shape is particularly concerning.
Further, the meta-analytic effect size points to an absence of an
effect. Both observations have been made in the paper describing this
meta-analysis in depth and are discussed there in more detail (Cristia,
2017). In all remaining cases the most frequent \emph{p}-values were the
smallest, this is in line with the expected distribution assuming there
is evidential value -- an observation confirmed by the according
statistical tests (see also Lewis et al., 2016).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

In this paper, we made use of a collection of standardized meta-analyses
to assess the status quo in developmental research regarding typical
effect sizes, sample size, power, and methodological choices.

We find that overall studies on language development, the sub-domain of
developmental research the present collection of meta-analyses is
focused on, are severely under-powered. This is particularly salient for
phenomena typically tested on younger children, because sample sizes and
effect sizes are both small; the one exception for research topics
tested mainly with infants before their first birthday is non-native
vowel discrimination, which can be attributed to a large meta-analytic
effect size estimate. Phenomena targeting older children tend to larger
effects, and here some studies turn out to be unnecessarily high-powered
(see for example \enquote{online word recognition}). Both observations
are first indicators that effect size estimates might not be considered
when determining sample size.

We investigated the alternative possibility that researchers base their
sample size on the effect size reported in the seminal paper of their
research topic. This turns out to be an unsuitable strategy: As
described in the results section, the larger the original effect size,
the more likely is an overestimation of the meta-analytic effect size.
Researchers might thus be wary of reports implying a strong, robust
effect with infants and toddlers in the absence of corroborating data.
The lack of a relationship between either overall meta-analytic effect
size or seminal reported effect size and sample size across phenomena
indicates that researchers' experiment planning is not impacted by an
estimated effect size of the phenomenon under investigation. Studies
might instead be designed and conducted with pragmatic considerations in
mind, such as participant availability.

To help researchers choose the most efficient method, and thus
potentially improve their power due to the use of a more sensitive
measure, we next turned to methods. Our investigation of method choice
considered both drop-out rates and whether effect sizes are differering
across methods. Overall, drop-out rates varied a great deal (with
medians between 5.9\% for forced-choice and 45\% for stimulus
alternation). However, high drop-out rates might be offset by high
effect sizes -- at least in the case of conditioned headturn. While
drop-out rates are around 30-50\%, effect sizes are above 1. Stimulus
alternation, in contrast, does not fall into this pattern of high
drop-out rates being correlated with high effect sizes, as the observed
effect sizes associated with this method are in the range typical for
meta-analyses in our dataset. The interpretation of this finding might
be that some methods, specifically conditioned headturn, which have
higher dropout rates, are better at generating high effect sizes due to
decreased noise (e.g., by excluding infants that are not on task).
However, there is an important caveat: Studies with fewer participants
(thanks to higher drop-out rates) might simply be underpowered, and thus
any significant finding is likely to over-estimate the effect. We
conclude thus that current efforts to estimate the impact of method
choice experimentally are an important endeavor in developmental
research (Frank et al., 2016).

A final set of analyses quantified whether the distribution of
\emph{p}-values below the significance threshold indicates either
questionable research practices or points towards no effect being
present. For the datasets that could be included in this analysis
(because they contained more than 10 \emph{p}-values below the
significance threshold of .05) we find no strong evidence of either the
null hypothesis being true or severe p-hacking (see Simonsohn et al.,
2014) -- with one exception that was to be expected based on the
original paper (Cristia, 2017). We thus conclude that the present
meta-analyses largely reflect phenomena that are real and are based on
reports that show no tangible symptoms of questionable research
practices.

\subsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}

The present paper has a number of limitations, the most salient on is
that the present collection of meta-analyses does not represent an
exhaustive survey of phenomena in language acquisition research.
Particularly, topics typically investigated in younger children are
over-represented. However, we sampled in an opportunistic and thus to
some degree random fashion, which lends some credibility to our
approach.

A second, and related, limitation pertains to the generalizability of
our findings across age groups in developmental research. It is possible
that developmental psychologists working with older age groups might
focus on different issues or find that power and experimental design
choices are less problematic; for instance, it may be easier to recruit
larger samples via institutional testing in schools, and older children
may be more reliable and consistent in their responses (Roberts \&
DelVecchio, 2000).

\textbf{If you have additional limitations you would like to add here,
please do so.}

\subsection{Concrete recommendations for developmental
scientists}\label{concrete-recommendations-for-developmental-scientists}

In this section, we aim to show how to move on from the status quo and
improved the reliability of developmental research.

\subsubsection{1. Calculate power
prospectively}\label{calculate-power-prospectively}

Our results indicate that most studies testing infants and toddlers are
severely underpowered. Further, power varies greatly across phenomena.
Our first recommendation is thus to assess in advance how many
participants would be needed to detect an effect. Note that we here
based our power estimations on whole meta-analyses. It might, however,
be the case that specific studies might want to base their power
estimates on a subset of effect sizes to match age group and method.
Both factors can, as we showed in our results, influence the to be
expected effect size. To facilitate such analyses, all meta-analyses are
shared on MetaLab and for each as much detail pertaining procedure and
measurements have been coded as possible.

\textbf{Do we want to think about a way to make such subset power
calculations easier?}

In lines of research where no meta-analytic effect size estimate is
available -- either because it is a novel phenomenon being investigated
or simply due to the absence of meta-analyses -- we recommend
considering typical effect sizes for the method used and the age group
being tested. This paper is a first step towards establishing such
measures, but more efforts and investigations are needed for robust
estimates (see for example Frank et al., 2016, and @Manybabies1 and
Cristia, Seidl, Singh, \& Houston (2016)).

One way to increase power is the use of more sensitive measurements; as
mentioned above we do find striking differences between methods. When
possible, it can thus be helpful to consider the paradigm being used,
and possibly swith to a more sensitive way of measuring infants'
capabilities. One reason that researchers do not choose the most robust
methods might to be due to a lack of consideration of meta-analytic
effect size estimate, which in turn might be (partially) due to a lack
of information on and experience in how to interpret effect size
estimates and use them for study planning (Mills-Smith, Spangler,
Panneton, \& Fritz, 2015). Thus one of the goals of this paper, and the
MetaLab platform in general, is to showcase what typical effect sizes in
developmental research are.

\subsubsection{2. Report all data}\label{report-all-data}

A possible reason for prospective power calculations and meta-analyses
being rare lies in the availability of data in published reports.
Reports and discussions of effect sizes in experimental studies are
rare, but despite long-standing recommendations to move beyond the
persistent focus on \emph{p}-values (such as American Psychological
Association (2001)), a shift towards effect sizes or even the reporting
of them has not (yet) been widely adopted (Mills-Smith et al., 2015).

A second impediment to meta-analyses in developmental science are
current reporting standards, which make it difficult and at times even
impossible to compute effect sizes from the published literature. For
example, for within-participant measures it is necessary to report the
correlation between conditions if two types of results are reported
(most commonly outcomes of a treatment and control condition). However,
this correlation, necessary to both compute effect sizes and their
variance, is habitually not reported and has to be obtained via direct
contact with the original authors (see for example Bergmann \& Cristia,
2016) or estimated (as described in Black \& Bergmann, 2017). In
addition, reporting (as well as analysis) of results is generally highly
variable, with raw means and standard deviations not being available for
all papers.

We suggest to report the following information, in line with current APA
guidelines: Means and standard deviations of dependent measures being
statistically analyses (for within-participant designs with two
dependent variables, correlations between the two should be added), test
statistic, exact \emph{p}-value (when computed), and effect sizes (for
example Cohen's \emph{d} as used in the present paper) where possible.
Such a standard not only follows extant guideliens but also creates
coherence across papers and reports, thus improving clarity (Mills-Smith
et al., 2015). A step further would be the supplementary sharing of all
anonymized results on the participant level, thus allowing for the
necessary computations and opening the door for other types of
cumulative analyses, for example in direct replications comparing raw
results.

\subsubsection{3. Increase availability and use of
meta-analyses}\label{increase-availability-and-use-of-meta-analyses}

Conducting a meta-analysis is a laborious process, particularly
according to common practice where only a few people do the work, with
little support tools and educational materials available. Incentives for
creating meta-analyses are low, as public recognition is tied to a
single publication. The benefits of meta-analyses for the field, for
instance the possibility to conduct power analyses, are often neither
evident nor accessible to individual researchers, as the data are not
shared and traditional meta-analyses remain static after publication,
aging quickly as new results emerge (S. Tsuji, Bergmann, \& Cristia,
2014).

To support the improvement current practices, we propose to make
meta-analyses available in the form of ready-to-use online tools,
dynamic reports, and as raw data. These different levels allow
researchers with varying interest and expertise interests to make the
best use of the extant record on infant language development, including
study planning by choosing robust methods and appropriate sample sizes.
There are additional advantages for interpreting single results and for
theory building that emerge from our collection of meta-analyses: On one
hand, researchers can easily check whether their study result falls
within the expected range of outcomes for their research question --
indicating whether or not a potential moderator influenced the result.
On the other hand, aggregating over many data points allows for the
tracing of emerging abilities over time, quantifying their growth, and
identifying possible trajectories and dependencies across phenomena (for
a demonstration see Lewis et al., 2016). Finally, by making our data and
source code open, we also invite contributions and can update our data,
be it by adding new results, file-drawer studies, or new datasets. Our
implementation of this proposal is freely online available at
\url{http://metalab.stanford.edu}.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{4. Rely on cumulative evidence to decide
whether skills are \enquote{absent} or
not}{4. Rely on cumulative evidence to decide whether skills are absent or not}}\label{rely-on-cumulative-evidence-to-decide-whether-skills-are-absent-or-not}

Developmental research often relies on interpreting both significant and
non-significant findings, particularly to establish a developmental
time-line tracing when skills emerge. This approach is problematic for
multiple reasons, as we mentioned in the introduction. Disentangling
whether a non-significant finding indicates the absence of a skill,
random measurement noise, or the lack of experimental power to detect
this skill reliably and with statistical support is in fact impossible
based on \emph{p}-values. Further, we want to caution researchers
against interpreting the difference between significant and
non-significant findings without statistically assessing it first
(Gelman \& Stern, 2006).

Concretely, we recommend the use of meta-analytic tools as demonstrated
in this paper as well as in the work by Lewis et al. (2016). Aggregating
over multiple studies allows not only for a more reliable estimate of an
effect (because any single finding might either be a false positive or a
false negative) but also makes it possible to trace developmental
trajectories. A demonstration of such a procedure is given in the work
of S. Tsuji \& Cristia (2014) for native and non-native vowel
discrimination. Their results match well with the standard assumption
that infants begin to tune into their native language at around six
months of age. For a contrasting example, see Bergmann \& Cristia
(2016), where the typically assumed developmental trajectory for word
segmentation from native speech could not be confirmed, as across all
included age groups infants seem to be able to detect words in the
speech stream -- the effect size of this skill is simply comparatively
small and thus it is difficult to detect (see also Bergmann, Tsuji, \&
Cristia, 2017 for a more recent discussion of both meta-analyses).

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

We have demonstrated the use of standardized collections of
meta-analyses for a diagnosis of (potential) issues in developmental
research. Our results point to an overall lack of consideration of
meta-analytic effect size in experiment planning, leading to habitually
under-powered studies. In addition, method choice and participant age
play an important role in the to be expected outcome; we here provide
first estimates of the importance of either factor in experiment design.
Assessing data quality, we find no evidence for quesitonable research
practices and conclude that most phenomena considered here have
evidential value. To ensure that developmental research is robust and
that theories of child development are built on solid and reliable
results, we strongly recommend an increased use of effect sizes and
meta-analytic tools, including prospective power calculations.
