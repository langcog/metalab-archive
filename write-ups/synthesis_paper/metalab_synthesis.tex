\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Psychologists hope to build generalizable theories about human
behavior---theories that hold true beyond particulars of an individual
study. The field has grown concerned as a result in the face of recent
high-profile evidence that an effect observed in one study may not be
the same in another (``replicability crisis''; Ioannidis, 2005; Nosek,
2012, 2015). Some of this variability is to be expected, however---the
question we should instead be asking is, do the data provide support for
the theory, even if they are noisy? Furthermore, to build parsimonious
theories of human behavior, we should seek to explain not just
individual phenemenon, but entire literatures of research. What is
needed, then, is a tool for aggregating noisy data across studies within
a phenomenon, as well as a common language for comparing effects across
phenomenona.

Meta-analytic methods provide a powerful tool for doing just this. The
basic unit of meta-analysis---the effect size---provides an estimate of
the \emph{size} of an effect, as well as a measure of uncertainty around
this point estimate. With such a continuous measure of success, we can
apply the same reasoning we use to aggregate noisy measurements over
participants in a single study: By assuming each \emph{study}, rather
than participant, is sampled from a population, we can appeal to the
classical statistical framework to combine estimates of the effect size
for a given phenomenon.

This quantitative approach provides a rich tool kit for synthesizing
across literatures. By describing different phenomena using the same
unit of measurement, we are able to compare effects in different
domains. Rather than simply concluding that two effects are both
``real,'' we can ask more fine-grained questions: Is effect \emph{X}
bigger than effect \emph{Y}? Does a moderator influence effect \emph{X}
in the same way as effect \emph{Y}? This type of continuous analysis
supports building quantitative models, and specifying theories that are
more precise and constraining.

In addition to these theoretical motivations, there are practical
reasons for conducting a quantitative synthesis. When planning an
experiment, an estimate of the size of an effect on the basis of prior
literature can inform the sample size needed to achieve a desired level
of power. Meta-analytic estimates of effect sizes can also aid in design
choices: If a certain paradigm tends to have overall larger effect sizes
than another, the strategic researcher might select this paradigm in
order to maximize the power of a study.

In practice, however, the feasability of this meta-analytic approach
relies on the field's commitment to practices that facilitate cumulative
science. These practices apply to all stages of the research process. At
the stage of experimental planning, researchers must pre-specify
analytical descision to limit ``researcher'' degrees of freedom
(Simmons, 2011; Simonsohn, 2014a, 2014b, 2014c). At the stage of
completion, researchers should share a result regardless of its
significance (Rosenthal, 1979; Fanelli 2012). And, at the stage of
sharing, researchers must provide enough information about the method
for another lab to conduct a close replication. Critically,r eports must
also contain complete descriptions of both data and analytical decisions
so that effect sizes can be calculcated for the purposes of
meta-analysis,

In the present paper, we use meta-analytic methods to provide a
quantitative synthesis of an entire field of psychological research:
language acquisition. We think this field is a particularly informative
case study. It may be particularly vulnerable to false findings because
running children is expensive (Ioanndis, 2005), and thus:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  sample sizes are small
\item
  replications difficult and rare
\item
  Recent attention about practices in developmental research Peterson

\end{itemize}

We have two goals:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Describe the state of the field in terms of its participation in
  practices that are prerequisites to cumulative science, and
  ultimately, a theoretical synthesis
\item
  Provide a preliminary theoretical synthesis of the field
\end{itemize}

\section{Method}\label{method}

We analyzed 11 different phenomenena in language acquisition. We
selected these phenomena in order to describe development at many
different levels of the language hierarchy, from the acquistion of
prosody and phonemic contrasts, to gaze following in linguistic
interaction. This wide range of phenomena allowed us to compare the
course of development across different domains, as well as explore
questions about the interactive nature of language acquisition (Table
1).

To obtain estimates of effect size, we coded papers reporting
experimental data. Within each paper, we calculated a separate effect
size estimate for each experiment and age group (\enquote{conditions}).
In total, our sample includes estimates from 258 papers, 938 different
conditions and 11,628 participants. The process for selecting papers
from the literature differed by domain, with some individual
meta-analyses using more systematic approaches than others.

\section{Replicability of the field}\label{replicability-of-the-field}

A literature is more likely to describe a real effect if studies are
randomly sampled from the population of all possible studies that
researchers could in principle conduct. This assumption does not mean,
however, that there should be \emph{no} variability in effect size
across studies: We should expect random variation around the true mean
effect size, with smaller studies showing more variability around this
mean.

Variability in effect sizes will be biased when this assumption of
random study sampling does not hold. Bias may be introduced by the
experimenter in a number of ways, including failure to publish null
findings (Fanelli, 2010; Rosenthal, 1979; ``publication bias'',
Rothstein, Sutton, \& Borenstein, 2006), analytical flexibility (e.g.,
``p-hacking'', Simmons, Nelson, \& Simonsohn, 2011; Simonsohn, Nelson,
\& Simmons, 2014), reporting errors, or even fraud. These biases are
problematic for theoretical development because they lead to large but
often unknown errors in estimates of the effect size. If bias is present
in the literature, estimates of effect size may be poor estimates of the
true underlying effect size and thus provide little evidential value. To
make theoretical progress, we must therefore distinguish variability in
effect sizes due to sample size from varability due to bias.

To assess the replicability of language acquisition phenomena, we
conducted several key analyses: Fail-safe-N, funnel plots, and p-curve.
These methods each have limitations, but taken together, they provide
converging evidence about the replicability of a literature. We find
little evidence of bias in our meta-analyses, suggesting that the
language acqusition literature describes real psychological phenomenona
and can therefore provide the basis for theoretical development.

\subsection{Fail-safe-N}\label{fail-safe-n}

One approach for quantifying the reliability of a literature is to ask,
How many missing studies with null effects would have to exist in order
for the overall effect size to be zero? This is called the
\enquote{fail-safe} number of studies. To answer this question, we
estimatated the overall effect size for each phenomenenon (Table 2,
column 2), and then used this to estimate the fail-safe-N (Table 2,
column 3). This analysis suggests that an unlikely number of studies
would have to be ``missing" in each literature (\(M\) = 3914) in order
for the overall effect sizes to be 0.

One limitation of this analysis, however, is that it assumes that all
reported effect sizes are obtained without p-hacking/analytical
flexibility: If experimenters (is this true?)

\subsection{Funnel Plots}\label{funnel-plots}

Funnel plots provide a visual method for evaluating whether variability
in effect sizes is due only to differences in sample size. Figure XX
plots effect sizes versus a metric of sample size, standard error. If
there is no bias in a literature, we should expect studies to be
randomly sampled around the mean, with more variability for less precise
studies.

Figure 1 presents funnel plots for each of our 11 meta-analyses. These
plots show evidence of asymmetry (bias) for several of our phenomenon
(Table 2, column 1). An important limitation of this method, however, is
that it is difficult to determine the source of this bias. One
possibility is that this bias is due not to experiment malfeasance, but
to true heterogenity in phenomena (e.g.~different ages). P-curves
provide a way to address this issue, which we turn to next.
