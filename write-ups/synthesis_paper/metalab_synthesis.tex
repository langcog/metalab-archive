\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

To learn to speak a language, a child must acquire a wide range of
knowledge and skills: the sounds of the language, the word forms, and
how words map to meanings, to name only a few. How does this process
unfold? Our goal as psychologists is to build a theory that can explain
and predict this process. But, acquiring a language requires not just
learning these skills in isolation; acquiring a language is the result
of the integration of a range of skills across the language hierarchy:
If the child is unable to segment \enquote{dog} from natural speech, a
child cannot be expected to understand the meaning of this word. In
building a theory of this system, a pragmatic research strategy has been
to study these skills primarily in isolation, describing the
developmental trajectory of individual phenomena in separate research
programs. However, if it is indeed the case that there are dependencies
between these skills, then we may not be able to ultimately understand
one skill without having a more complete picture of other skills.

A substantial challenge in building this theory is that we must do so on
the basis of limited, noisy experimental findings. As a consequence, the
raw material of our theories are often contradictory. This leaves the
theorist with uncertainty about which experimental findings should
constrain the theory. Here, we suggest that reframing experimental
findings in terms of quantitative, rather than qualitative,
descriptions, we can aggregate across findings to evaluate the
evidential strength for a phenomenon. Furthemore, by treating the raw
data of our theories as quantitative estimates, we can make quantitative
predictions, and build more constraining theories. In this paper, we
consider the domain of language acquisition and demonstrate how
meta-analytic methods can support these two goals.

Meta-analysis is a quantitative method for aggregating across
experimental findings. The fundamental unit of meta-analysis is the
\emph{effect size}: a scale-free, quantitative measure of
\enquote{success} in a phenomenon. Importantly, an effect size provides
an estimate of the \emph{size} of an effect, as well as a measure of
uncertainty around this point estimate. With such a quantitative measure
of success, we can apply the same reasoning we use to aggregate noisy
measurements over participants in a single study: By assuming each
\emph{study}, rather than participant, is sampled from a population, we
can appeal to the classical statistical framework to combine estimates
of the effect size for a given phenomenon.

Meta-analytic methods support theory building in several ways. First,
they provide a way of evaluating which effects in a literature are most
likely to be observed consistently, and thus should constrain the
theory. This is particularly important in light of recent high-profile
evidence in the field that an effect observed in one study may not
replicate in another (``replication crisis,'' Ioannidis, 2005; Open
Science Collaboration, 2012, 2015). Failed replications are difficult to
interpret, however, because they may result from a wide variety of
causes, including an in initial false positive, a subsequent false
negative, or differences between initial and replication studies, and
making causal attributions in a situation with two conflicting studies
is often difficult (Anderson et al., 2016; Gilbert, King, Pettigrew, \&
Wilson, 2016). Meta-analysis can allow researchers to address this set
of issues in a principled way by aggregating evidence across studies and
assuming that there is some variability in true effect size from study
to study. In this way, meta-analytic methods can provide more veridical
description of the empirical landscape, which in turn leads to better
theory-building.

Second, meta-analysis supports theory building by providing higher
fidelity descriptions of phenomena. Given an effect size estimate,
meta-analytic methods provide a method for quantifying the amount
variability around this point estimate. Furthermore, the quantitative
framework allows researchers to detect potential moderators in effect
size. This ability is particularly important for developmental phenomena
because building a theory requires a precise description of changes in
effect size across development. Individual papers typically describe an
effect size for 1-2 age groups, but the ultimate goal is to detect a
moderator---age---in this effect. Given that moderator always require
more power to detect (Button et al., 2013), it may be quite difficult to
detect developmental trends in effect sizes from individual papers. By
aggregating across papers through meta-analytic methods, however, we may
be able to detect these changes, leading to a more precise description
of the empirical phenomena.

In addition to providing a quantiative measure of success, effect size
estimates also provide a common language for comparing \emph{across}
phenomena. In the current work, this common language allows us to
meaningfully consider the relationship between different phenomena in
the language acquisition domain (\enquote{meta-meta-analysis}). Through
cross-phenomena comparisons, we can understand not only the trajectory
of a particular phenomenon, like word learning for example, but also how
this phenomenon might relate to other skills, such as sound learning,
gaze following, and many others.

Finally, in addition to these theoretical motivations, there are
practical reasons for conducting a quantitative synthesis. When planning
an experiment, an estimate of the size of an effect on the basis of
prior literature can inform the sample size needed to achieve a desired
level of power. Meta-analytic estimates of effect sizes can also aid in
design choices: If a certain paradigm or measure tends to yield overall
larger effect sizes than another, the strategic researcher might select
this paradigm in order to maximize the power achieved with a given
sample size

While meta-analytic methods are broadly applicable to psychological
literatures, language acquisition may be a particularly informative
application for this tool. One reason is that language acquisition may
be uniquely vulnerable to false findings because running children is
expensive, and thus sample sizes are small and studies are underpowered
(Ioannidis, 2005). In addition, the high cost and practical difficulties
associated with collecting large developmental datasets means that
replications are relatively rare in the field. Finally, there has been
attention to developmental psychology research practices more broadly,
suggesting evidence of experimenter bias (Peterson, 2016).

We take as our ultimate goal a broad theory of language acquisition that
can explain and predict the range of linguistic skills a child acquires.
Toward this end, we developed a dataset of effect sizes in the language
acquisition literature across 12 different core phenomena
(\href{http://metalab.stanford.edu}{Metalab;
http://metalab.stanford.edu/}). We demonstrate how meta-analysis
supports building this theory in two ways. We first use meta-analytic
techniques to evaluate the evidential value of the empirical landscape
in language acquisition research. We find broadly that this literature
has strong evidential value, and thus that the effects report in the
literature should constrain our theorizing of language acquisition. We
then turn toward the task of synthesizing these findings across
phenomena and offer a preliminary theoretical synthesis of the field.

\section{Method}\label{method}

We analyzed 12 different phenomena in language acquisition. These
particular phenomena were selected opportunisticaly, either because of
high prevalence in the literature or because a published meta-analysis
already existed. The phenomena cover development at many different
levels of the language hierarchy, from the acquisition of prosody and
phonemic contrasts, to gaze following in communicative interaction. This
wide range of phenomena allowed us to compare the course of development
across different domains, as well as to explore questions about the
interactive nature of language acquisition (Table 1).

To obtain estimates of effect size, we coded papers reporting
experimental data. Within each paper, we calculated a separate effect
size estimate for each experiment and age group (we refer to this as a
\enquote{condition}). In total, our sample includes estimates from 269
papers, 981 different conditions and 12,029 participants. {[}RELIABILITY
CODING?{]} The process for selecting papers from the literature differed
by domain, with some individual meta-analyses using more systematic
approaches than others (see SI). \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}

\section{Replicability of the field}\label{replicability-of-the-field}

To assess the replicability of language acquisition phenomena, we
conducted several diagnostic analyses: Meta-analytic estimates of effect
size, fail-safe-N (Orwin, 1983), funnel plots, and p-curve (Simonsohn,
Nelson, \& Simmons, 2014b, 2014a; Simonsohn, Simmons, \& Nelson, 2015).
These analytical approaches each have limitations, but taken together,
they provide converging evidence about the presence of publication bias,
questionable research practices, and the replicability of a literature.
Overall, we find most phenomena in the language acquistion literature
has evidential value, and should therefore provide the basis for
theoretical development. evidence of bias in our meta-analyses,
suggesting that the language acquisition literature likely describes
real psychological phenomena and {[}FIX THIS{]}

\subsection{Meta-Analytic Effect Size}\label{meta-analytic-effect-size}

To estimate the overall effect size of a literature, effect sizes are
pooled across papers to obtain a single meta-analytic estimate. This
meta-analytic effect-size can be thought of as the ``best estimate'' of
the effect size for a phenomenon given all the available data in the
literature.

Table 2, column 2 presents meta-analytic effect size estimates for each
of our phenomena We find evidence for a non-zero effect size in 11 out
of 12 of the phenomena in our dataset, suggesting these literature
provide evidential value. In the case of phonotatic learning, however,
we find that the meta-analytic effect size estimate does not differ from
zero, suggest that this literature does not describe a robust effect.
{[}Remove it from analyses below?{]}.

While the measure of effect size is itself quantitative, meta-analytic
estimates of effect size provide only categorical information about the
evidential value of a literature: the effect is real, or not. But, a
more powerful method of assessing evidential value would tell us the
\emph{degree} to which a literature has evidential value, and thus the
degree to which it should constrain our theory building. In the
following three analyses---fail-safe-N, funnel plots, and p-curves---we
attempt to quantify the evidential value of these literatures.

\subsection{Fail-safe-N}\label{fail-safe-n}

One approach for quantifying the reliability of a literature is to ask,
How many missing studies with null effects would have to exist in the
\enquote{file drawer} in order for the overall effect size to be zero?
This is called the \enquote{fail-safe} number of studies (Orwin, 1983).
To answer this question, we estimated the overall effect size for each
phenomenon (Table 2, column 2), and then used this to estimate the
fail-safe-N (Table 2, column 3).

Because of the large number of positive studies in many of the
meta-analyses we assessed, this analysis suggests a very large number of
studies would have to be \enquote{missing} in each literature (\(M\) =
3634) in order for the overall effect sizes to be 0. Thus, while it is
possible that some reporting bias is present in the literature, the
large fail-safe-N suggests that the literature nonetheless likely
describes a real effect.

One limitation of this analysis, however, is that it assumes that all
reported effect sizes are obtained in the absence of analytical
flexibility: If experimenters are exercising analytical flexibility
through practices like p-hacking, then the number and magnitude of
observed true effects in the literature may be inflated. In the next
analysis, we examine this possibility through funnel plots.

\subsection{Funnel Plots}\label{funnel-plots}

Funnel plots provide a visual method for evaluating whether variability
in effect sizes is due only to differences in sample size. A funnel plot
shows effect sizes versus a metric of sample size, standard error. If
there is no bias in a literature, we should expect studies to be
randomly sampled around the mean, with more variability for less precise
studies.

Figure 1 presents funnel plots for each of our 12 meta-analyses. These
plots show evidence of asymmetry (bias) for several of our phenomenon
(Table 2, column 4). However, an important limitation of this method is
that it is difficult to determine the source of this bias. One
possibility is that this bias reflects true heterogeneity in phenomena
(e.g.~different ages). P-curve analyses provide one method for
addressing this issue, which we turn to next.

is represented by a point, and the mean effect size is shown as a red
dashed line. The funnel corresponds to a 95\% (narrow) and 99\% (wide)
CI around this mean. In the absense of true heterogenity in effect sizes
(no moderators) and bias, we should expect all points to fall inside the
funnel.}

p-curve (blue) to be right-skewed (more small values). The red dashed
line shows the expected distribution of p-values when the effect is
non-existent (the null is true). The green dashed line shows the
expected distribution if the effect is real, but studies only have 33\%

A p-curve is the distribution of p-values for the statistical test of
the main hypothesis across a literature (Simonsohn et al., 2014b, 2014a,
2015). Critically, if there is a robust effect in the literature, the
shape of the p-curve should reflect this. In particular, we should
expect the p-curve to be right skewed with more small values (e.g., .01)
than large values (e.g., .04). An important property of this analysis is
that we should expect this skew independent of any true heterogeneity in
the data, such as age. Evidence that the curve is in fact right-skewed
would suggest that the literature is not biased, and that it provides
evidential value for theory building.

Figure 2 shows p-curves for 7 of our 12
meta-analyses.\footnote{We did not conduct p-curves on all meta-analyses because previously published meta-analyses did not include test statistics and the key test statistics in some others were inappropriate for p-curve. }
With the exception of phonotactic learning, all p-curves show evidence
of right skew. This is confirmed by formal analyses (Table 2, column 5).

In sum, then, meta-analytic methods, along with our dataset of effect
sizes, provide an opportunity to assess the replicability of the field
of language acquisition. Across a range of analyses, we find that this
literature shows some evidence for bias, but overall, is quite robust.

\section{Theoretical development}\label{theoretical-development}

Next, we turn to how these data can be used to constrain and develop
theories of language acquisition.

Meta-analytic methods provide a precise, quantitative description of the
developmental trajectory of individual phenomena. Figure 3 presents the
developmental trajectories of the phenomena in our dataset at each level
in the linguistic
hierarchy.\footnote{The Pointing and Vocabulary dataset is excluded from this analysis because it does not contain effect sizes at multiple ages.}
By describing how effect sizes change as a function of age, we can begin
to understand what factors might moderate that trajectory, such as
aspects of a child's experience or maturation. For example, the
meta-analysis on mutual-exclusivity (bias for children to select a novel
object, given a novel word; (\textbf{???}){]} suggests a steep
developmental trajectory of this skill. We can use these data to then
build quantitative models to understand how aspects of experience
(e.g.~vocabulary development) or maturational constraints may be related
to this trajectory (e.g., M. C. Frank, Goodman, \& Tenenbaum, 2009;
McMurray, Horst, \& Samuelson, 2012).

{[}There are also large differences in the relative magnitude of ES of
different skills. Theoretical point about overt skills have larger ES{]}

\caption{Effect size as a function of age from 0-3 years, across 11
different phenomena. These developmental curves suggest there is
interactivity across language skills, rather than sequential learning of
the linguistic hierarchy}
\end{figure}

In addition, meta-analytic methods provide an approach for synthesizing
across different linguistic skills via the language of effect sizes. The
ultimate goal is to use meta-analytic data to build a single,
quantitative model of the language acquisition system, much like those
developed for individual language acquisition phenomena, like word
learning. Developing a single quantitative model is a lofty goal,
however, and will likely require much more precise description of the
phenomena than is available in our dataset. Nevertheless, we can use our
data to distinguish between broad meta-theories about the relationship
between different skills.

There are two existing meta-theories in the literature about the
dependencies between different skills in language acquisition. The
first---the ``bottom-up" theory---proposes that linguistic skills are
acquired sequentially beginning with skills at the lowest level of the
linguistic hierarchy. Under this theory, once a skill is mastered, it
can be used to support the acquisition of skills higher in the
linguistic hierarchy. In this way, a child sequentially acquires the
skills of language, \enquote{bootstrapping} from existing knowledge at
lower levels to new knowledge at higher levels. There is a wide range of
evidence consistent with this view. For example, there is evidence that
prosody supports the acquisition of sound categories {[}CITE{]}, word
boundaries {[}CITE{]}, and even word learning (e.g., Shukla, White, \&
Aslin, 2011).

A second possibility is that there is interactivity in the language
system such that multiple skills are learned simultaneously across the
system. Under this proposal, a child does not wait to begin learning the
meanings of words until the sounds of a language are mastered, for
example; rather, the child is jointly solving the problem of word
learning in concert other language skills. This possibility is
consistent with predictions of a class of hierarchical Bayesian models
that suggest that more abstract knowledge may be acquired quickly,
before lower level information, and may in turn support the acquisition
of lower information (``Blessing of abstraction,'' Goodman, Ullman, \&
Tenenbaum, 2011). There is evidence for this proposal from work that
that suggests word learning is supported the acquisition of lower-level
information like phonemes (Feldman, Myers, White, Griffiths, \& Morgan,
2013). More broadly, there is evidence that higher level skills like
word learning may be acquired relatively early in development, likely
before lower level skills have been mastered (e.g., Bergelson \&
Swingley, 2012)

Within the meta-analytic framework of effect-sizes, we can represent
these two theories schematically in figure 4a (bottom-up) and 4b
(interactive) {[}A figure here?{]}. This framework also allows us to
specify a much larger space of possible theories, however. By specifying
several parameters of the framework, such as the shape of the
developmental trajectory (e.g., linear or logarithmic), direction of the
trajectory (upward or downward) and the age at which acquisition begins,
we can consider many possible meta-theories of development.

Our data allow us to begin to differentiate between this space of
theories. Figure 5 presents a holistic representation of the
developmental trajectories of all the skills in our dataset. We find
strong evidence for interactivity---children begin learning even
high-level skills like the meanings of words early on in development,
and even low-level skills like sound categories show a protracted period
of development. Moving forward, we can use this approach to distinguish
between a larger space of meta-theories and, ultimately, build a single
quantitative theory of language acquisition.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Building a theory of a complex psychological phenomenon requires making
good inductive inferences from the available data. We suggest that
meta-analysis can support this process by allowing the researcher to
verdically describe the to-be-explained behavior, and to do so with
high-fidelity. Here, we apply the meta-analytic toolkit to the domain of
language acquisition---a domain where there are concerns of
replicability, and where high-fidelity data is needed to explain its
complexity. We find that the existing literature in this domain describe
robust phenomena and thus should form the basis of theory development.
We then offer a preliminary synthesis of the field by aggregating across
language acquisition phenomena. We find evidence that linguistic skills
are acquired interactively rather than in a strictly bottom-up fashion.

There are a number of important limitations to the meta-analytic
approach as a theoretical tool. First, this method relies on researchers
conducting replications of the same study across a range of ages and,
critically, reporting these data so that they can be used in
meta-analyses. To the extent that researchers do not conduct these
studies, or report the necessary statistics in their write-ups (e.g.,
means and standard deviations), the meta-analytic method cannot be
applied. Second, the meta-analytic method, as for qualitiative forms of
synthesis (e.g.~literature review), is limited by the potential presence
of bias, which can come from a ranges of sources including
non-representative participant populations, failure to publish null
findings, and analytical degrees-of-freedom. To the extent these biases
are present in the literature, methods of synthesizing these findings
will also be biased.

In addition, there are a number of more substantive concerns with this
method. One possibility is that the magnitude of effect may be more
related to the method than the psychological phenomenon. While this may
be true to some extent, we find that method does not have a large impact
on effect size for a phenomena, relative to other moderators like age
(see SI). Another issue is that meta-analysis usually measures signal to
noise, not units of interest (e.g.~ability in an absolute sense), so
there could be important confounds with respect to this.
