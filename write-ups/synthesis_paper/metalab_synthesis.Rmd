# Introduction
To learn to speak a language, a child must acquire a wide range of knowledge and skills: the sounds of the language, the word forms, and the mappings of words to meanings, to name only a few. How does this process unfold? Our goal as psychologists is to build a broad theory that can explain and predict this process. An important aspect of this theory is an account of how the acquisition of  individual skills depends on other skills. For example, the theory must describe to what extent a child must master language sounds before beginning the process of learning the meanings of words. To develop this theory, a pragmatic research strategy has been to study  skills primarily in isolation, describing the developmental trajectories of individual phenomena in separate research programs. This research shows that, while the onset of these skills can often be found in the first year of life, most follow a protracted pattern of development, with important changes occurring in the second year and beyond. Importantly, however, if linguistic skills are in fact interdependent, then this casts doubt on results based on the isolationist method, and suggests that we may not be able to understand individuals skills without a more precise understanding of the broader system. 

The theory building effort is further complicated by the fact that we typically have some uncertainty about the trajectory of individual skills. Developmental trajectories are often communicated as verbal descriptions that summarize a body of noisy experimental findings. However, in actual fact, there is often one study finding an effect, but another failing to do so. These contradictions leave the theorist with uncertainty about	which experimental findings should constrain the theory, which is often resolved by verbally discounting one or the other finding depending on the viewer's expertise (and potentially theoretical penchant). What is needed then is a method for resolving these contradictions in a more systematic and principled fashion.

We suggest a solution to both of these challenges---building integrative whole-system views and evaluating evidential strength in a field of scientific research---is to describe experimental findings in quantitative, rather than qualitative, terms. Quantitative descriptions allow for the use of quantitative methods for aggregating experimental findings in order to evaluate evidential strength. In addition, describing experimental findings as quantitative estimates provides a common language for comparing across phenomena, and a way to make more precise predictions. In this paper, we consider the domain of language acquisition and demonstrate how the quantitative tools of meta-analysis can support theory building in psychological research. 

Meta-analysis is a quantitative method for aggregating across experimental findings. The fundamental unit of meta-analysis is the *effect size*: a scale-free, quantitative measure of "success" in a phenomenon. Importantly, an effect size provides an estimate of the *size* of an effect, as well as a measure of uncertainty around this point estimate. With  this quantitative measure, we can apply the same reasoning we use to aggregate  noisy measurements over  participants in a single study: By assuming each *study*, rather than participant, is sampled from a population, we can appeal to a statistical framework to combine estimates of the effect size for a given phenomenon.

Meta-analytic methods support theory building in several ways. First, they provide a way to evaluate which effects in a literature are most likely to be observed consistently, and thus should constrain the theory. This issue is particularly important in light of recent high-profile evidence that an effect observed in one study may not replicate in another ["replication crisis,"  @ioannidis2005most; @open2015estimating; @open2012open]. Failed replications are difficult to interpret, however, because they may result from a wide variety of causes, including an initial false positive, a subsequent false negative, or differences between initial and replication studies, such that making causal attributions in a situation with two conflicting studies is often difficult [@Gilbert1037; @anderson2016response].  By aggregating evidence across studies and assuming that there is some variability in true effect size from study to study, meta-analytic methods can provide a more veridical description of the empirical landscape, which in turn leads to better theory-building.

Second, meta-analysis supports theory building by providing higher fidelity descriptions of phenomena. Given an effect size estimate, meta-analytic methods provide a method for quantifying the amount variability around this point estimate. Furthermore, the quantitative framework allows researchers to detect potential moderators in effect size. This ability is particularly important for developmental phenomena because building a theory requires a precise description of changes in effect size across development. Individual papers typically describe an effect size for 1-2 age groups, but the ultimate goal is to detect a moderator---age---in this effect. Given that moderators always require more power to detect [@button2013power], it may be quite difficult to identify developmental trends in effect sizes from individual papers. By aggregating across papers using meta-analytic methods, however, we may be better able to detect these changes, leading to a more precise description of the empirical phenomena.

Finally, effect size estimates also provide a common language for comparing *across* phenomena.  In the current work, this common language allows us to meaningfully consider the relationship between different phenomena in the language acquisition domain ("meta-meta-analysis"). Through cross-phenomena comparisons, we can understand not only the trajectory of a particular phenomenon, such as word learning, but also how the trajectory of each phenomenon might relate to other skills, such as sound learning, gaze following, and many others. This more holistic description of the empirical landscape can inform theories about the extent to which there is interdependence between the acquisition of different linguistic skills.

Meta-analytic tools are broadly applicable to psychological literatures, but developmental research may be a particularly informative application of these tools. One reason is that developmental studies may be uniquely vulnerable to false findings because running children is expensive, and thus sample sizes are small and studies are underpowered [@ioannidis2005most]. In addition, the high cost and practical difficulties associated with collecting large developmental datasets means that replications are relatively rare in the field. Finally, there has been attention to research practices in developmental psychology, suggesting evidence of experimenter bias [@Peterson:2016].  

We take as our ultimate goal a broad theory of language acquisition that can explain and predict the range of linguistic skills a child acquires. Toward this end, we developed a dataset of effect sizes in the language acquisition literature across 12 phenomena ([Metalab; http://metalab.stanford.edu/](http://metalab.stanford.edu)). We demonstrate how meta-analysis supports building this theory in three ways. We first use meta-analytic techniques to evaluate the evidential value of the empirical landscape in language acquisition research. We find broadly that this literature has strong evidential value, and thus that the effects reported in the literature should constrain our theorizing of language acquisition. We then turn toward the task of synthesizing these findings across phenomena and finally offer an example of quantitative evaluation of theories.

We analyzed `r nrow(datasets)` different phenomena in language acquisition. To a certain extent, these  phenomena were selected opportunistically, either because of high prevalence in the literature or because a published meta-analysis already existed. The phenomena cover development at many different levels of the language hierarchy, from the acquisition of prosody and phonemic contrasts, to gaze following in communicative interaction. This wide range of phenomena allowed us to compare the course of development across different domains, as well as to explore questions about the interactive nature of language acquisition (Table 1). 

To obtain estimates of effect size, we either coded or adapted others’ coding of papers reporting experimental data (see SI for details). Within each paper, we calculated a separate effect size estimate for each experiment and age group (we refer to this as a "condition"). In total, our sample includes estimates from `r sum(datasets$num_papers)` papers, `r sum(datasets$num_experiments)` different conditions and `r format(floor(sum(datasets$num_subject)), big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` participants. The process for selecting papers from the literature differed by domain, with some individual meta-analyses using more systematic approaches than others (see SI for specific search strategies).

# Replicability of the field
To assess the replicability of language acquisition phenomena, we conducted several diagnostic analyses: Meta-analytic estimates of effect size, fail-safe-N [@orwin1983fail], funnel plots, and p-curve [@simonsohn2014p; @simonsohn2014power; @simonsohn2015better]. These analytical approaches each have limitations, but taken together, they provide converging evidence about whether a true effect is likely to exist, and the extent to which publication bias and other questionable research practices are present in the literature. Overall, we find most phenomena in the language acquisition literature have evidential value, and should therefore provide the basis for theoretical development.  We also find evidence for some bias, as well as evidence that two phenomena---phonotactic learning and statistical sound learning---likely describe null or near-null effects. 

## Meta-Analytic Effect Size
```{r, overall_d}

overall_es <- function(ma_data){
  model = metafor::rma(ma_data$d_calc, ma_data$d_var_calc, method = "REML",
               control = list(maxiter = 1000, stepadj = 0.5))
    data.frame(dataset = ma_data$short_name[1],
               overall.d = model$b,
               ci_lower = model$ci.lb,
               ci_upper = model$ci.ub)
}

all_ds = all_data %>%
  split(.$short_name) %>%
  map(function(ma_data) overall_es(ma_data)) %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  mutate_each_(funs(round(., digits = 2)), 
               vars = c("overall.d", "ci_lower", "ci_upper")) %>%
  mutate(d_string = paste0(overall.d, " [", ci_lower, ", ",ci_upper, "]")) %>%
  mutate(short_name = dataset)
```
To estimate the overall effect size of a literature, effect sizes are pooled across papers to obtain a single meta-analytic estimate. This meta-analytic effect-size can be thought of as the "best estimate" of the effect size for a phenomenon given all the available data in the literature. Table 2, column 2 presents meta-analytic effect size estimates for each of our phenomena. We find evidence for a non-zero effect size in 11 out of 12 of the phenomena in our dataset, suggesting these literatures provide evidential value. In the case of phonotactic learning, however, we find that the meta-analytic effect size estimate does not differ from zero, suggesting that this literature does not describe a robust effect. 

We next turn to methods of assessing evidential value that describe the *degree* to which a literature has evidential value, and thus the degree to which it should constrain our theory building. In the following three analyses---fail-safe-N, funnel plots, and p-curves---we attempt to quantify the evidential value of these literatures.

## Fail-safe-N
```{r, fail_safe_N}
fsn.package.data = all_data %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  summarise(fsn_package = fsn(d_calc, d_var_calc, data = all_data, 
                         target = .01, type="Orwin")$fsnum) %>%
  left_join(datasets %>% select(name, short_name), by= c("dataset" = "name")) %>%
  rename(fsn_string = fsn_package)
```

One approach for quantifying the reliability of a literature is to ask, How many missing studies with null effects would have to exist in the "file drawer" in order for the overall effect size to be zero? This is called the "fail-safe" number of studies [@orwin1983fail]. This number provides an  estimate of the size and variance of an effect using the intuitive unit of studies. To estimate this number, we estimated the overall effect size for each phenomenon (Table 2, column 2), and then used this to estimate the fail-safe-N (Table 2, column 3). 

Because of the large number of positive studies in many of the meta-analyses we assessed, this analysis suggests a very large number of studies would have to be "missing" in each literature ($M$ = `r round(mean(fsn.package.data$fsn_string[is.finite(fsn.package.data$fsn_string)]))`) in order for the overall effect sizes to be 0. Thus, while it is possible that some reporting bias is present in the literature, the large fail-safe-N suggests that the literature nonetheless likely describes a real effect. 

This analysis provides a quantitative estimate of the size of an effect in an intuitive unit, but it does not assess analytical or publication bias [@scargle1999publication]. Importantly, if experimenters are exercising analytical flexibility through practices like selective reporting and p-hacking, then the number and magnitude of observed true effects in the literature may be greatly inflated. In the next analysis, we assess the presence of bias through funnel plots.

## Funnel Plots 
Funnel plots provide a visual method for evaluating whether variability in effect sizes is due  only to differences in sample size. A funnel plot shows effect sizes versus a metric of sample size, standard error. If there is no bias in a literature, we should expect studies to be randomly sampled around the mean, with more variability for less precise studies. 

Figure 1 presents funnel plots for each of our `r nrow(datasets)` meta-analyses. These plots show evidence of asymmetry (bias) for several of our phenomenon (Table 2, column 4). However, an important limitation of this method is that it is difficult to determine the source of this bias. One possibility is that this bias reflects true heterogeneity in phenomena (e.g. different ages)\footnote{The role of moderators such as age can be interactively explored on the MetaLab website (www.metalab.stanford.edu).}. P-curve analyses provide one method for addressing this issue, which we turn to next.

```{r,  fig.pos = "T!", fig.width=8, fig.height=5.5, fig.cap = "Funnel plots for each meta-analysis. Each effect size estimate is represented by a point, and the mean effect size is shown as a red dashed line. The grey dashed line shows an effect size of zero. The funnel corresponds to a 95%  CI around this mean. In the absence of true heterogeneity in effect sizes (no moderators) and bias, we should expect all points to fall inside the funnel."}

A p-curve is the distribution of p-values for the statistical test of the main hypothesis across a literature [@simonsohn2014p; @simonsohn2014power; @simonsohn2015better]. Critically, if there is a robust effect in the literature, the shape of the p-curve should reflect this. In particular, we should expect the p-curve to be right-skewed with more small values (e.g., .01) than large values (e.g., .04). An important property of this analysis is that we should expect this skew independent of any true heterogeneity in the data, such as age. Evidence that the curve is in fact right-skewed would suggest that the literature is not biased, and that it provides evidential value for theory building.

P-values for each condition were calculated based on the reported test statistic. However, test statistics were not available for many conditions, either because they were not reported or because they were not coded. To remedy this, we also calculated p-values indidrectly based on descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations; see SI for details). 

Figure 2 shows p-curves for each of our `r nrow(datasets)` meta-analyses. All p-curves show evidence of right skew, with the exception of phonotactic learning and statistical sound learning (Table 2, column 5). This pattern did not differ when only reported 

In sum, then, meta-analytic methods, along with our dataset of effect sizes, provide an opportunity to assess the replicability of the field of language acquisition. Across a range of analyses, we find that this literature shows some evidence for bias, but overall, it is quite robust.

# Quantitative Evaluation of Theories

Next, we turn to how these data can be used to constrain and develop theories of language acquisition. 

Meta-analytic methods provide a precise, quantitative description of the developmental trajectory of individual phenomena. Figure 3 presents the developmental trajectories of the phenomena in our dataset at each level in the linguistic hierarchy.\footnote{The pointing and vocabulary dataset is excluded from this analysis because it does not contain effect sizes at multiple ages.} By describing how effect sizes change as a function of age,  we can begin to understand what factors might moderate that trajectory, such as aspects of a child's experience or maturation.  For example, the meta-analysis on mutual-exclusivity [the bias for children to select a novel object, given a novel word; @markman1988] suggests a steep developmental trajectory of this skill. We then can use these data to build quantitative models to understand how aspects of experience (e.g. vocabulary development) or maturational constraints may be related to this trajectory [e.g., @frank2009using; @mcmurray2012word].

In addition, meta-analytic methods provide an approach for synthesizing across different linguistic skills via the language of effect sizes. The ultimate goal is to use meta-analytic data to build a single, quantitative model of the language acquisition system, much like those developed for individual language acquisition phenomena, like word learning. Developing a single quantitative model is a lofty goal, however, and will likely require much more precise description of the phenomena than is available in our dataset. Nevertheless, we can use our data to distinguish between broad meta-theories about the interdependency of skills.

We first consider two intuitive theories of task-to-task dependencies that have been articulated in a number of forms. The stage-like theory proposes that linguistic skills are acquired sequentially beginning with skills at the lowest level of the linguistic hierarchy. Under this theory, once a skill is mastered, it can be used to support the acquisition of skills higher in the linguistic hierarchy. In this way, a child sequentially acquires the skills of language, "bootstrapping" from existing knowledge at lower levels to new knowledge at higher levels. There is a wide range of evidence consistent with this view. For example, there is evidence that prosody supports the acquisition of sound categories [e.g., @werker2007infant], word boundaries [e.g., @jusczyk1999beginnings], grammatical categories [e.g. @shi1999newborn], and even word learning [e.g., @shukla2011prosody]. 

A second possibility is that there is interactivity in the language system such that multiple skills are learned simultaneously across the system. For example, under this proposal, a child does not wait to begin learning the meanings of words until the sounds of a language are mastered; rather, the child is jointly solving the problem of word learning in concert with other language skills. This possibility is consistent with predictions of a class of hierarchical Bayesian models that suggest that more abstract knowledge may be acquired quickly, before lower level information, and may in turn support the acquisition of lower information ["blessing of abstraction," @goodman2011learning]. There is evidence for this proposal from work that suggests word learning supports the acquisition of lower-level information like phonemes [@feldman2013word]. More broadly, there is evidence that higher level skills like word learning may be acquired relatively early in development, likely before lower level skills have been mastered [e.g., @bergelson2016].

These two theories make different predictions about relative trajectories of skills across development. Within the meta-analytic framework,  we can represent  these different trajectories schematically by plotting the effect sizes for different skills across development. In particular, the bottom-up theory predicts serial acquisition of skills (Figure 4; left) while the interactive theory predicts simultaneous acquisition (left center). We can also specifify many other possible trajectories by varying the functional form and parameters of the model. Figure 4 (right center; "ad hoc") shows several other possible trajectories. For example, a skill might have a non-monotonic trajectory, increasing with age, and then decreasing. By specifying the shape of these developmental trajectories and the age at which acquisition begins, we can consider many patterns of developmental trajectories, and these different patterns, in turn, constrain our meta-theories of development. 

Our data allow us to begin to differentiate between this space of theories. Figure 4 (right) presents a synthetic representation of the developmental trajectories of all the skills in our dataset. We find strong evidence for the simultaneous acquisition of skills---children begin learning even high-level skills, like the meanings of words, early in development, and even low-level skills like sound categories show a protracted period of development. This pattern is consistent with an interactive theory of language aquisition. Moving forward, we can use this approach to distinguish between a larger space of meta-theories and, ultimately, refine our way towards a single quantitative theory of language acquisition.

# Discussion
Building a theory of a complex psychological phenomenon requires making good inductive inferences from the available data. We suggest that meta-analysis can support this process by allowing the researcher to veridically describe the to-be-explained behavior, and to do so with high-fidelity. Here, we apply the  meta-analytic toolkit to the domain of language acquisition---a domain where there are concerns of replicability, and where high-fidelity data is needed to explain its complexity. We find that the existing literature in this domain describe mostly robust phenomena and thus should form the basis of theory development. We then offer a preliminary synthesis of the field by aggregating across phenomena. We find evidence that linguistic skills are acquired interactively rather than in a strictly stage-like fashion.

In this paper, we focused on seldom-discussed theoretical motivations for building meta-analysis, but naturally, there are many other practical reasons for conducting a quantitative synthesis. For example, when planning an experiment, an estimate of the size of an effect on the basis of prior literature can inform the sample size needed to achieve a desired
level of power. Meta-analytic estimates of effect sizes can also aid in design choices: If a certain paradigm or measure tends to yield overall larger effect sizes than another, the strategic researcher might select this paradigm in order to maximize the power achieved with a given sample size. These and other advantages, illustrated with the same database used here, are explained in Bergmann et al.\ (in prep.). 

Despite its potential, there are a number of important limitations to the meta-analytic method as tool for theory building in psychological research. One challenging issue is that in many cases method and phenomenon are confounded. This is problematic because a method with less noise than another will produce a bigger effect size for the same phenomenon. As a result, it is difficult to determine the extent to which a difference in effect size between two phenomena is due to an underlying difference in the phenomena, or merely to a difference in methods. While method may account for some variability in our dataset, we find that method does not have a large impact on effect size for phenomena, relative to other moderators like age (see SI). Nevertheless, the covariance between method and phenomenon in our dataset limits our ability to directly compare effect sizes across phenomena.

Second, meta-analysis, like all analysis methods, requires the researcher to make analytical decisions, and these decisions may be subject to the biases of the researcher. We believe that a virtue of the current approach is that we have applied the same analytical method across all phenomena we examined, thus limiting our “degrees of freedom” in the analysis. However, in some cases this uniform approach to data analysis means that we are unable to take into consideration aspects of a particular phenomenon that might be relevant. For example, in a stand-alone meta-analysis on vowel discrimination, Tsuji and Cristia (2014) elected only to include papers that tested at least two different age groups in order to minimize the bias introduced by experimenters tailoring their experimental designs to specifc age groups. Others however might have reasonably dealt with this issue in another way, by normalizing effect sizes across methods, for example. Notably, this analytical decision has consequences for interpretation: Tsuji and Cristia (2014) found a moderate decrease in effect size with age for non-native vowel discrimintation, while the current analysis suggests a moderate increase. We believe that the systematic, uniform analytical approach used here is the most likely to minimize bias by the researcher and reveal robust psychological phenomena. However, there may be cases where this one-size-fits-all approach is inappropriate, particularly in meta-analyses with high heterogeneity.

There are also limits to this method for inferring a meta-theory of language acquisition. Meta-theories of language acquisition suggest a particular causal relationship between different  skills and how they change over development. For example, the interactive theory suggests that skills at lower levels *support* the acquisition at higher levels, even before skills at lower levels are mastered. In the meta-analytic framework, this predicts that there should be simultaneous development of skills across the language hierarchy---as we observe in the current work. Importantly, however, this analysis is inherently correlational, and therefore we cannot directly infer a causal relationship between acquisition at lower levels and acquisition at higher levels. That is, while the observed pattern is consistent with the interactive theory, it is also possible that there is *no* causal relationship between skills across the language hierarchy, merely parallel trajectories of acquisition. For this reason, experimental work must go hand-in-hand with meta-analysis to address these types of causal questions.

Finally, there are a number of important limitations to the meta-analytic method more broadly. One issue is that the method relies on researchers conducting replications of the same study across a range of ages and, critically, reporting these data so that they can be used in meta-analyses. To the extent that researchers do not conduct these studies, or report the necessary statistics in their write-ups (e.g., means and standard deviations), the meta-analytic method cannot be applied. In addition, the meta-analytic method, as in the case of qualitative forms of synthesis (e.g., literature review), is limited by the potential presence of bias, which can come from a ranges of sources including non-representative participant populations, failure to publish null findings, and analytical degrees-of-freedom. To the extent these biases are present in the literature, methods of synthesizing these findings will also be biased.

In sum, understanding the psychological mechanisms underlying complex phenomena is a difficult inferential task: The researcher must develop a predictive and explanatory theory on the basis of limited and noisy experimental data. Here we have focused on language acquisition as a case study of how meta-analytic methods can be productively leveraged as a tool for theory building. Meta-analytic methods allow the researcher to  determine whether phenomena are robust, synthesize across contradictory findings, and ultimately, build an integrative theory across phenomena. Moving forward, we see this as a powerful tool in the researcher’s toolkit for developing quantitative theories to account for complex psychological phenomena.
