We welcome researchers interested in contributing to Metalab. Please contact us at metalab-project@googlegroups.com

Contributions can take various forms:

1. Adding unpublished data. Ideally we can link to a report on the data, for example on [OSF](http://osf.io). Then contact the curator 
with a link and if possible all necessary data.
2. Suggesting and/or adding published papers not yet included. Simply email the curator, ideally with a pdf. If you are the author, try to make sure that all necessary data is either included or provided in your email. 
3. Creating new meta-analyses. You can either collaborate on current in-progress projects (see below) or create your own meta-analyses. In the latter case see the section listing resources further down. 

**New meta-analyses looking for contributors**

Currently, the following topics are in the process of becoming a meta-analysis and we are looking for contributors:

* Segmenting words from an artificial stream of speech, an extension of [*InWordDB*](http://inworddb.acristia.org); contact: [*Christina Bergmann*](http://sites.google.com/site/chbergma/home/contact)
* Detecting mispronunciations of known words, without a learning phase in the lab; contact: [*Christina Bergmann*](http://sites.google.com/site/chbergma/home/contact)
