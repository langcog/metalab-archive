<p>MetaLab is a research tool for aggregating across studies in the language acquisition literature. Currently, MetaLab contains 714 effect sizes across meta-analyses in 6 domains of language acquisition, based on data from 174 papers collecting 13962 subjects. These studies can be used to obtain better estimates of effect sizes across different domains, methods, and ages. Using our power calculator, researchers can use these estimates to plan appropriate sample sizes for prospective studies. More generally, MetaLab can be used as a theoretical tool for exploring patterns in development across language acquisition domains.</p>
<p>Individual meta-analyses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Phonemic discrimination (native)</strong> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/inphondb/">(Tsuji &amp; Cristia, 2014)</a> [N papers = 40, N effect sizes = 167]</p>
<p>Discrimination of vowels, including results from behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging methods applied to infants 0-14 months of age.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phonemic discrimination (non-native)</strong> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/inphondb/">(Tsuji &amp; Cristia, 2014)</a> [N papers = 21, N effect sizes = 72]</p>
<p>Discrimination of vowels, including results from behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging methods applied to infants 0-14 months of age.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Word segmentation</strong> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/inworddb/">(Bergmann &amp; Cristia, 2015)</a> [N papers = 61, N effect sizes = 265]</p>
<p>Recognition of familiarized words from running, natural speech using behavioral methods applied to infants 0-20 months of age.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Infant directed speech preference</strong> <a href="http://earlyliteracylearning.org/cellreviews/cellreviews_v5_n1.pdf">(Dunst, Gorman, &amp; Hamby, 2012)</a> [N papers = 16, N effect sizes = 50]</p>
<p>Looking times as a function of whether infant-directed vs.Â adult-directed speech is presented as stimulation, in infants aged 0-XX months.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mutual exclusivity</strong> <a href="http://figshare.com/articles/Disambiguation_Meta_Analysis/1348836">(Lewis &amp; Frank, in prep)</a> [N papers = 20, N effect sizes = 60]</p>
<p>Mutual exclusivity is the bias for children to assume a novel word refers to a novel object, in the presence of one novel and one familiar object. This meta-analysis covers behavioral experiments on infants aged XX to XX.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Label advantage in concept learning</strong> <a href></a> [N papers = 16, N effect sizes = 100]</p>
<p>Previous research suggests that labels support the formation of novel categories in young children. This meta-analysis includes studies exploring this question that use a paradigm similar to Balaban and Waxman (1997), resulting in a selection of experiments using behavioral methods on infants XX to XX months.</p></li>
